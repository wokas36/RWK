# RWK: Regularized Wasserstein Graph Kernels

This is a Python3 implementation of RWK. This framework provides a novel optimal transport distance metric, namely Regularized Wasserstein Kernels (RWK) for graphs, that enables fast computations of distances between graphs under the preservation of feature and structural properties.

### Prerequisites

* Torch (>= 1.7.1)
* Networkx (>= 2.2)
* POT [Python Optimal Transport] (>=0.7.0)
* Sklearn (>= 0.19.1)
* Numpy (>=1.19.0)
* Scipy (>=1.2.1)
* Cython (>=0.27.3)
* Matplotlib (>=2.2.2)

### Evaluation and dataset references

We use 12 benchmark datasets grouped in two categories. 
(1) Graphs with discrete attributes
(2) Graphs with continuous attributes
You can find more details of our datasets from `DATASET_DESCRIPTIONS.md` file.

We have evaluated our method using twelve datasets against 16 state-of-the-art baselines. 

The experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on all benchmark 
datasets for two different graph settings: 
* graphs with discrete attributes 
* graphs with continuous attributes

We consider three settings in our experiments: 

* `RWK-0` - without using local variations
* `RWK-1` - with using 1-hop local variations
* `RWK` - with using 2-hop local variations (default setting)

We use the nested cross validation setup to evaluate our method.
